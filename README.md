## Description
<p align="justify">This project's goal is to predict the presence of sleep disorders in individuals using machine learning models. By analyzing key health-related parameters, the model assists in identifying potential sleep disorder cases, which can lead to early intervention and improved quality of life. Sleep disorders, such as insomnia and sleep apnea, affect millions globally, leading to severe health and productivity issues. However, many cases remain undiagnosed. This project aims to build a predictive model to assist healthcare providers in identifying individuals at risk, optimizing healthcare resources, and guiding timely treatment.
